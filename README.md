# SSWhen

## Getting Started

SSWhen is an ionic project using typescript. The backend API uses MongoDB as a data source for a loopback api server. The corresponding backend server can be found at: 

```
https://github.com/SoftStackFactory/SSWHEN-bk
```



### Prerequisites

To begin make sure node and npm are installed. Please make sure latest Node 6 LTS and NPM 3+ are installed. In addition, make sure that you have [Ionic CLI](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/) installed locally. This project was uses Ionic 3.x. 

```
npm install -g ionic
```


### Branches

SSWHEN employs a git flow methodology for branch naming. When creating new branches, work off of develop only.

`master` - Current release working production branch

`develop` - Next release development branch.

For new features, use the convention: `/feature/**feature-name**`

For hotfixes, use the convention: `/bug/**bug-name**`


### Installing

Clone the remote repository

```
git clone https://github.com/SoftStackFactory/SSWHEN
```

From within the `SSWHEN` directory, run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Once that completes, use `ionic serve` to get a local copy running

```
ionic serve
```

This should deploy an instance of the app running locally at:

```
http://localhost:8100/
```
